File takes two arguments, the first is an input file, the second is an output file.
Input should follow the same format as the initial given example, where the first 3 lines are header.

File output needs to be opened with other software besides notepad. 
For some reason notepad is not reading display the newline characters correctly,
but output appears normal in console and in notepad++. 
This is probably due to only LF being present without the CR.

e.g. java Lab2Hashing <input.txt> <output.txt>
